# CONTRIBUTING

## Overview

The code is quite modular and here is a brief overview how it works.

There is a global variable `SHOW_DEBUG` which is taken as a parameter by almost
all functions. If this is set to true it shows useful debugging info and a nice
progress bar.

Inside the `dwc` folder the python codes reside.

* `ballontip.py` sends a notification to the notification panel. (for Windows OS
only)

* `debug.py` prints download status bar on the terminal.

* `utils.py` does the following - 

    1. `save_image`: This takes url of image, path where the image will be saved
    locally and SHOW_DEBUG as parameters. It returns the path where the image is
    saved.

    2. `set_wallpaper_permanent`: This takes the path of the image where it is
    saved locally and `SHOW_DEBUG` as parameters. It changes the wallpaper to
    the specifies image and also sends a notification.

* If you want to add another source simply create a file in the `dwc/sources`
folder and use the above functionalities.

## Getting Involved

open an issue if you have spotted a bug or create a pull request if you have
added a cool feature! 

### Making a pull request

Please open a **new issue** before making any pull request if it doesn't exist.
**Every pull request should have a reference to an issue**. Also please make
sure there is no open pull request for the same issue.

* First, fork this repository.

* Clone it using `git clone https://github.com/[username]/Desktop-Wallpaper-Changer.git`

* It is always recommended to make your changes in a new branch rather than
master. So create a new branch using `git branch my_branch`.

* Checkout into your new branch using `git checkout my_branch`.

* Hack the code, kill the bug or introduce the new feature you had in mind, do
all kinds of awesome stuff.

* After you are done add your changes using `git add --all`

* Commit your changes using git commit and provide a commit message:
`git commit -m "<commit message>" `.

* After you have committed your changes push your changes to your forked
repository using `git push origin my_branch`.

* Finally create a pull request from github.

* If everything is alright then soon your changes will get merged or else you
will be asked to make changes.


Please try to make sure that your commit message and body follows the guidelines
below.

* Commit message should be of the form:
